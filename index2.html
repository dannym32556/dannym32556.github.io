    <h1>many people have died brutally from Pneumonic and Septicemic and buboes plauge</h1>
      
    <tr>
        <td>Septicemic pleage  had no cure people just died with internal bleeding,blood infetion and fever</td>
        <td>pneumonic pleauge gave them respiratory faliure,fever and Severe pneumonia </td>
        <td>there was a possibility of survival was with is Bubonic where they would get fever,chills,vomitting and Buboes </td>
    </tr>
   <p>Patients typically developed painful buboes—swollen lymph nodes in the groin or armpits—alongside fever, chills, vomiting, and extreme fatigue. Without antibiotics, bubonic plague was fatal in 30% to 75% of cases within days, while pneumonic and septicemic forms were almost universally lethal</p>
<h2> how did it impact??</h2>

<p>The dramatic population decline upended feudal societies. Labor shortages empowered surviving peasants and artisans to demand higher wages and better conditions, contributing to the decline of serfdom and reshaping Europes agrarian economy</p>
<p>The Black Deaths legacy endures in modern medicine, public health, and social structures. It catalyzed empirical approaches to disease—moving away from miasma and astrological theories—and laid groundwork for the Scientific Revolution. Economically, it ushered in wage-based labor systems, accelerated urbanization, and set Europe on new trajectories of state-building and global exploration</p>

<p>The rapid depopulation caused labor shortages, leading to economic shifts, weakened feudalism, and changes in land use. Socially, the plague instilled fear, sometimes resulting in persecution of minorities such as Jewish communities falsely accused of causing the disease. The Black Death also influenced religious thought and art, emphasizing themes of death and mortality.</p>
<p>Symptoms began suddenly with fever, chills, headaches, and nausea, progressing to swollen buboes in the groin, armpits, or neck, along with vomiting and fatigue. Untreated plague often led to death within days, with mortality rates estimated between 30% and 60% during the initial outbreaks. The pandemic killed approximately 25 to 50 million people in Europe alone—about one-third to one-half of its population</p>
<p>The Black Death was caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, transmitted primarily through flea bites from infected black rats. It spread rapidly through Europe between 1347 and 1351, with origins traced to Central Asia or China, moving westward via trade routes and ships carrying infected rats and fleas. Genomic studies confirm that the strain responsible for the Black Death is ancestral to modern plague bacteria</p>
    
<p>The Black Death, a devastating pandemic from 1347 to 1352, killed an estimated 25 to 50 million people in Europe and reshaped societies, economies, and medical practices. It is primarily caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, spread by fleas on rats, and had profound consequences throughout history.</p>
 <p>The Black Death refers to the bubonic plague pandemic that struck Europe from 1347 to 1352. It is regarded as one of the deadliest pandemics in history, resulting in the death of approximately 30% to 60% of Europe's population at the time. This catastrophic event not only decimated populations but also brought significant social, economic, and cultural upheaval.</p>
